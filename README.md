# Web Systems and Technologies Activities

This repository contains a collection of activities for my third-year subject, **CCS7 - Web Systems and Technologies**. Only activities that use **PHP** and **MySQL** are included. The files are meant to be used with XAMPP and its provided modules. 

## Requirements
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) (latest version)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Place in XAMPP's htdocs folder**  
   Clone or download this repository and place it in your XAMPP installation directory under the `htdocs` folder.

2. **Start the XAMPP Apache Server**  
   Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache, and optionally, the MySQL module.

3. **Access via Web Browser**  
   Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
   
   http://localhost/webtech-activities/

   You can navigate to specific folders or activities from there.

## Notes
- Ensure your `php.ini` configuration allows required PHP extensions (e.g., `mysqli` or `pdo_mysql`).
